# ContactManager
This project is a contact management application.
The programming language used is python, in particular pyqt5 was used for the graphic interface.

## Application structure
The project has been implemented following the Model–view–viewmodel (**MVVM**) pattern: this allows to have a separation 
between the application logic and the graphical user interface.

Here there are a Model `contactsModel.py` and three views (`allContactsView.py`, `detailContactView.py` and `newContactView.py`).


## Run the application
- from terminal go to the directory in which you have downloaded the project
- go inside the ContactManager folder using the command:  `cd ContactManager`
- then run the application with the command: `python main.py`
